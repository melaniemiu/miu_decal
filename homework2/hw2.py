# 1) Suppose your current working directory is ~/Desktop/classes/python_decal/. What command would allow you to navigate directly to ~/Desktop?
    # cd~
# 2) What does ~/ mean?
    # it moves one folder to another
# 3) What is the difference between absolute pathway and relative pathway?
    # Absolute = the entire pathway to a folder vs relative (how to get to another folder from your current folder)
# 4) What command would bring you back to your home directory?
    # cd~
# 5) If you called rm ./ in your current working directory, what would it do? 
    # Deletes all files within that directory.
# 6) In your current working directory, what does calling "git add" do? What about "git commit"? What about "git push"?
    # git add = adds all modified and new files to the current directory. git commit = captures a snapshot of the changes made to a project. git push = it's copying info to make sure your remote file matches that of the local repository.
# 7) Let's say you call "git add" in your current working directory and then "git status". What message would appear? What is it telling you?
    # "changes to be commited" would appear, indicating that those files are ready for the next commit command.
# 8) What has been the most frustrating error or bug you've encountered in this class so far? How did you troubleshoot and resolve it?
    # i accidentally made two miu_decal files in my mac and trying to get this homework file into my miu_decal folder was hell because there was another file with the same name :(
# 9) How does cloning a repository differ from pulling from a repository?
    # Cloning = copying the remote server repo into my actual computer vs pulling - getting new changes that have been added to the repo into my computer.
# 10) Tell me a fun fact!
    # i did not know that there was homework due today...
